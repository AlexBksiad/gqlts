> Introducing Genqlx
# Type safe Graphql query builder

Genql generates a typed graphql client for your graphql api to use in browser or node.

> This package is forked version from [genql](https://github.com/remorses/genql/)
> It has been updated, fixed few bugs, actively adding features and updated dependencies and codebase to the latest packages

To use genqlx you first need to generate a sdk client

```ts
import { createClient, everything } from '@genql/my-lib'
await createClient().query({
    User: {
        name: true,
        surname: true,
        address: {
            ...everything,
        }
    }
})
```
## works in browser and node


## Graphql queries written in code

### Genqlx generates a graphql client with typescript types, giving you type safety and auto-completion

```ts
import { createClient, everything } from '@genqlx/my-lib'

await createClient().query({
    User: {
        name: true,
        surname: true,
        address: {
            ...everything,
        }
    }
})`;
```

```ts
query {
    User {
        name
        surname
        address {
            city
            state
        }
    }
}`;
```
