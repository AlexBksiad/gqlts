# Type safe Graphql query builder for TypeScript and Node.js

```js
import { createClient, everything } from '@gqlts/my-lib'
const { data, errors, extensions } = await createClient().query({
    User: {
        name: true,
        surname: true,
        address: {
            ...everything,
        }
    }
});
// data.User
```
## works in browser and node


## Graphql queries written in code

### Gqlts generates a graphql client with typescript types, giving you type safety and auto-completion

```js
import { createClient, everything } from '@gqlts/my-lib'

const { data, errors, extensions } = await createClient().query({
    User: {
        name: true,
        surname: true,
        address: {
            ...everything,
        }
    }
})`;
// data.User
```

```js
query {
    User {
        name
        surname
        address {
            city
            state
        }
    }
}`;
