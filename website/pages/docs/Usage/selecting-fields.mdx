# Selecting fields

Genql queries are similar to graphql queries in structure, to select some fields you pass an object where the keys are the field names.

Here is an example of a query made with the client generated from the Quick start guide

```js
import { createClient } from './generated'

const client = createClient()

client
    .query({
        countries: {
            name: true,
            code: true,
            languages: {
                name: true,
            },
        },
    })
    .then(console.log)
```

# Passing arguments

If you want to pass arguments to a query you must use an array where the first object represents the arguments and the second object the fields selection.

```js
import { createClient } from './generated'
const client = createClient()

client
    .query({
        countries: [
            {
                filter: { code: 'BR' },
            },
            {
                name: true,
                code: true,
                languages: {
                    name: true,
                },
            },
        ],
    })
    .then(console.log)

client
    .mutation({
        createUser: [{ user: { name: 'user' } }, { name: true, age: true }],
    })
    .then(console.log)
```

# Querying all fields

Genql let you query all scalar fields in a type by using the `everything` object:

```js
client
    .query({
        countries: {
            ...everything,
            languages: {
                ...everything,
            },
        },
    })
    .then((x) => console.log(JSON.stringify(x)))
```

> `everything` queries only the leaf types, it does not work for nested types
